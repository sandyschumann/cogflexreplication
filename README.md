# Does Cognitive Inflexibility Predict Violent Extremist Behaviour Intentions? A Registered Direct Replication Report of Zmigrod et al., 2019

This is the code and data repository for the analysis of our registered direct replication of Study 1 of Zmigrod and colleagues' (2019) paper 'Cognitive Inflexibility Predicts Extremist Attitudes'. Supplementary Material is uploaded in the repository as well.

## Requirements

The project uses R language.

R dependencies:
* R version: 3.6.2
* R packages: Commands to install and run the required R packages are included in the respective analysis script.



## Content of the repository

This repository includes the following scripts and directories.

### Analysis scripts

- analysis_Step1
This is the first script to be run to describe the sample and identify how many participants failed the attention check.

- analysis_Step2
This script is to calculate the reliability of the 'willingness to fight' scale, descriptive statistics, and correlations between all variables used in original study (test Hypothesis 1).

- analysis_Step3
This script is to test Hypothesis 2.

- analysis_Step4
This script is to test Hypothesis 3.

- analysis_Step5
This script is to identify scale properties of the CFI and ARIS scales.

- analysis_Step6
This script is to conduct all additional analyses, complementing tests for Hypothesess 1-3.

- analysis_Step7
This script is to examine scale properties of the scales willingness to fight and item willingness to die.

- analysis_Step8
This script is to conduct further exploratory analyses.
